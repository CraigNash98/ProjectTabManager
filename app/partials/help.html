        <h1>Welcome to<br>Project Tab Manager!</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Thank you for installing Project Tab Manager.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have you been opening 100 tabs on your Chrome?</li>
          <li>Consuming gigabytes of memory just by running Chrome?</li>
          <li>Distracted by social media while you are working because they are open in other tabs?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Worry no more! Project Tab Manager (PTM) helps you solve those problems!</p>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>PTM automatically tracks all windows you open in Chrome. You can resume to previous state anytime you want. Just keep in mind 2 rules:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If you want to keep a session, close the window not tabs.</li>
          <li>Open a web page.</li>
          <li>Open PTM by clicking on folder icon.</li>
          <li>Enter a name of the window then save. This will be your first poject.</li>
          <li>You're all set.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="img/assets/new_project.png" alt="">
        <p>PTM is that simple. Whenever you want to resume the project, just click on the project name from PTM pop up. Try following to see how powerful this extension is.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open new tabs in previously saved window.</li>
          <li>Close the window (not tabs, but window itself).</li>
          <li>Open PTM by clicking on folder icon.</li>
          <li>Click on the saved project to resume.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="img/assets/saved_project.png" alt="">
        <p>You should now see the same tab sets restored. Got the idea? Enjoy!</p>

      <h2>Further Instructions</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Saving bookmarks</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Saving project stores all tabs as bookmarks. PTM also track other tabs opened in the same window so that you can restore them by opening the project later. But what if you close one of those tabs and want to open it again? By bookmarking important tabs, you can easily come back to the same page.</li>
          <li>In PTM, bookmarks are actually saved as bookmarks on Chrome. Try opening Bookmark Manager and look for a folder named "Project Tab Manager" (default). You'll see list of bookmarks and folders (by project name) stored on PTM there.</li>
          <li>This enables you to access same bookmarks on Chrome for iOS and Chrome for Android, if you are signed in to Chrome.</li>
        </ul>

        <summary>Editing Projects</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>Editing project names, bookmark names, sorting are not supported on PTM.</li>
