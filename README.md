# Welcome to Project Tab Manager!

Thank you for installing Project Tab Manager.

Project Tab Manager helps you manage flood of tabs. Treat windows as projects and focus on what you are focusing on. Close windows and resume anytime.

## Getting Started
PTM automatically tracks all windows you open in Chrome. You can resume those windows anytime you want. See how it works:

### 1. Click on PTM icon

### 2. Do you see list of dates? They represent session windows. Create a project by clicking on the folder icon.

### 3. Name the project. Your window will be linked to this project and it will contain links to all tabs.

### 4. Check out Chrome's bookmark folder. The project is stored as Chrome's standard bookmarks. So it is synced across devices and even accessible from Chrome for Android or for iOS.

### 5. The stars indicate if they are temporary sessions or synced bookmarks. Adding / modifying tab's URLs will be locally tracked, but not synced. Add stars to sync.

### 6. Feel free to close the window. You can restore the state anytime!

### There are just 2 rules to remember:
- **Closing window enables you to resume project status whenever you want**
- **Closing a tab eliminates the page from the project unless you star it**

### Keyboard Navigation

- You can navigate through PTM using keyboard.
    - **tab:** selects next project.
    - **return:** opens the selected project.
    - **right arrow:** expands project folder
    - **left arrow:** folds project folder
- If you want to open PTM with a short cut key, open "chrome://extensions" and go to bottom of the page to find "Keyboard shortcuts" then assign.
